# PCA_portfolios_djia
 Used PCA and dimensionality reduction on the historical 20 years(2000-2019) DJIA data downloaded from yahoo finance to find the optimal eigen portfolios. The top ten factors explained about 73% of the returns of the 30 stocks. Found the weights for each principle component and plotted the weights of every company at the current chosen principle component. To find the best eigen portfolios computed the principle component's weight for each eigen portfolio and then used the sharpe ratio function to look for the portfolio with the highest sharpe ratio. 
 The top portfolio of the training data gave annualized return of 11.5%, volatility of 13.3% and a sharpe ratio of 0.862.
 On the testing data two of the portfolios in the top docile gave returns of 23.2%, volatility of 11.27%, sharpe ratio of 2.06 and returns of 32.76%, volatility of 68.64%, sharpe ratio of 0.48 respectively while one of the portfolios of the bottom docile gave a return of -79.42% with volatility 185.30% and a sharpe of -0.43.
 In conclusion trained the model on data from year 2000 to 2015-07 and the results on test data from year 2015-08 to 2019 shows that the top docile portfolios significantly outperformed the equally weighted DJIA portfolio. 
 These can be combined with bottom docile portfolios to make a reliable long-short strategy.
